MISSING ITEMS : 

1) Not calling Trends API calling Search based tweets and taking text from it for world cloud ... This is just a service creation in Node and hooking that to TrendsComponent in React instead of tweets
2) Code Cleanup
3) On Node not handled error scenarios
4) Code Cleanup
5)  Documentation along with Architecture Diagram
6) Need to move secrets (keys to connect to twitter) need to be moved in .env file
7) using a logger instead of console.logs
